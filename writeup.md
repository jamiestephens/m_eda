# MTA Turnstile and Property Sales Trends in the Upper West Side
Jamie Stephens

## Abstract

The goal of this project was to clean and analyze two datasets to find what relationship existed between trends in MTA turnstile data at the 66th St-Lincoln Center station, located in Manhattan's Upper West Side, and the property sale count of the surrounding area. 

## Data

* Metropolitan Transit Authority: Turnstile Data
  * [Link: Turnstile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)
  * Pre-aggregation, dataset was 252,976 rows of turnstile entrance and exit totals, reported in four-hour increments
 
* NYC Department of Finance: Manhattan  New York City Sales Data 
  * [Link: Detailed Annual Sales Reports by Borough](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-annualized-sales-update.page)
  * Pre-aggregation, dataset was 7,705 rows of completed property sales in the Upper West Side neighborhood between 59th Street and 79th Street

## Analysis

The MTA turnstile data was collected, collated, and organized. All station data outside of the 66th-St Lincoln Center was removed, as well as turnstile data that was clearly generated by machine errors (for example, a single turnstile recording over a million entrances between 11pm and 3am). Additionally, only entrance data with reporting times between 8am and 12pm were retained, to reduce noise and maximize the chances that residential subway patterns would be captured. Property data was collected and only records for Upper West Side properties within 59th and 79th Street were retained. Later, the datasets were aggregated to: 
1. the number of total entrances between 8am and 12pm for the entire station, monthly and
2. the number of properties sold in the area, monthly

After graphing the monthly datasets, both for total properties sold and residential properties sold, I calculated correlation matrices. For total properties, there exists a correlation of -0.29. For residential properties, the correlation coefficient was -0.28.

## Tools
* Python
  * BeautifulSoup: web scraping to acquire initial data files
  * SQLAlchemy: link Pandas datasets to a SQLite database
  * Matplotlib: data visualization
  * Pandas: data organization and analysis
  * NumPy: statistical analysis
* SQLite: data cleaning 

## Communication

I presented on this analysis in April 2021, with the following graphs contained within Powerpoint slides to illustrate the relationship between the two datasets.
