# MTA Turnstile and Property Sales Trends in the Upper West Side
Jamie Stephens

## Abstract

The goal of this project was to clean and analyze two datasets to find what relationship existed between trends in MTA turnstile data at the 66th St-Lincoln Center station, located in Manhattan's Upper West Side, and the property sale count of the surrounding area. 


## Data

* Metropolitan Transit Authority: Turnstile Data
  * [Link: Turnstile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)
  * Pre-aggregation, dataset was 252,976 rows of turnstile counts
 
* Property 
  * [Link: Detailed Annual Sales Reports by Borough](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-annualized-sales-update.page)
  * Pre-aggregation, dataset was 7,705 rows of completed property sales in the Upper West Side neighborhood between 59th Street and 79th Street

## Analysis

The data was compiled using BeautifulSoup, a Python library that facilitates web scraping to find similarly formatted text or files. The datasets were then imported, cleaned, and aggregated in SQLite through Python's SQLAlchemy library.
This involved excluding property sales from outside the Upper West Side, MTA data from turnstiles other than that of 66th-St Lincoln Center, and turnstile data that was clearly generated by machine errors (for example, a single turnstile recording over a million entrances between 11pm and 3am). 


After graphing the monthly datasets, both for total properties sold and residential properties sold, I calculated correlation matrices using NumPy.

## Communication

I presented on this analysis in April 2021, with the following graphs to illustrate
